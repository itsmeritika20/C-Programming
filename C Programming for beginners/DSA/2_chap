Algorithm:-
An algorithm is the step by step instructions to solve a given problem

Sum(n):
Algorithm to add first n natural numbers.Assumes s is a Variable initialized to 0.
1.If n<=0 return -1
2.Repeat step 3 and 4 while n!=0
3.s=s+n 
4.[decrement n]n--
return s

Analysis of algorithm:-
The goal of analysis of algorithms is to compare algorithms mainly in terms of running time 
but also in terms of other factors(like memory,efforts etc)

Rate of growth:-
The rate at which the running time increases as a function of input

Types of analysis:-
To analyze the given algorithm we need to know on what inputs the algorithm takes less time 
and on what inputs the algorithm takes huge time
->Worst case
->Average case
->Best case

Asymptotic Notations:-
</>For all three cases we need to identify the upper and lower bounds
</>Syntax of representations of bound are:
-Big-O Notation
-Omega- Notation
-Theta- Notation
