Variables:placeholders for representing data

Datatypes:set of data with values having predefined characteristics
System/Compiler defined datatype = primitive datatype
Struture in C/C++ and clases in C++/Java are create own = user defined datatype

Data Struture: particular way of storing and organising data in a computer so that it 
can be used efficiently
two types:
1)Linear Data structure(array,link list,stack,queue)
2)Non Linear Data Struture(tree,graph)

Abstract Datatypes(ADT):
->All primitive Datatypes support basic operations like addition, subtraction etc.
->The system is providing the implementation for primitive datatypes.
->For non primitive datatypes we also need to define operations.
Combination of data structure and their operations are known as Abstract Datatypes.
//So data structure is all about creating Abstract datatypes.Any piece of information 
can be handled by defining apt datatypes and set of possible operations.//

Algorithm:-
An algorithm is the step by step instructions to solve a given problem

Sum(n):
Algorithm to add first n natural numbers.Assumes s is a Variable initialized to 0.
1.If n<=0 return -1
2.Repeat step 3 and 4 while n!=0
3.s=s+n 
4.[decrement n]n--
return s

Analysis of algorithm:-
The goal of analysis of algorithms is to compare algorithms mainly in terms of running time 
but also in terms of other factors(like memory,efforts etc)

Rate of growth:-
The rate at which the running time increases as a function of input

Types of analysis:-
To analyze the given algorithm we need to know on what inputs the algorithm takes less time 
and on what inputs the algorithm takes huge time
->Worst case
->Average case
->Best case

Asymptotic Notations:-
</>For all three cases we need to identify the upper and lower bounds
</>Syntax of representations of bound are:
-Big-O Notation
-Omega- Notation
-Theta- Notation
