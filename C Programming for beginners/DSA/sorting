Sorting:
->The process of arranging the data in some logical order.
->This logical order may be ascending or descending in case of numerical values or dictionary 
order in case of alpha numeric values.

Two types
-Internal Sorting
-External Sorting

Bubble Sort:
->This is very simple and easy to implement sorting technique.
->until unless explicitly stated sorting means ascending order
Example:
  0 1 2 3
A 8 4 5 1
Logic starts with comparision of first two elements and if the lest elementis greater 
than right, they swap their position.comparision proceeds till the end of the array.

Algorithm:
BUBBLE_SORT(A,N):A is arrayof values N no of elements.
1.repeat for round=1,2,3,...N-1
2.repeat for i=0,1,2,...N-1-round
3.if A[i]>A[i+1] then swap A[i] & A[i+1]
4.Return
